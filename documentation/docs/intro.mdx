# Introduction

In many organisations, the meaning of data is spread across documents, tools and people’s heads.
Definitions, rules and constraints are discussed, rewritten and reinterpreted over time, often with different results.

Medatarun is used to make these definitions explicit and shared, so they can be read, discussed and reused by everyone (
business, tech people, tools and AI) not just implemented in code.

This documentation is organised around the main things you can do with Medatarun.
