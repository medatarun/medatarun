# CLI Usage

Medatarun allows you to interact with the server from the command line.

It exposes the same action model as the server itself: each command triggers an explicit operation.

The CLI is mainly intended for:
- bootstrapping and administration,
- automation and scripting,
- exploration and inspection.

### Prerequisites

The Medatarun server must be running.

The `medatarun` command must be available in your shell. If not, see the [installation page](../installation/install-from-distribution).

Most commands require authentication.


### Authentication

Before running most commands, you must be authenticated.

To log in, run:

```bash
medatarun auth login --username="admin" --password="admin.0123456789"
```

The command returns an access token.

Make it available to the CLI by setting the `MEDATARUN_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export MEDATARUN_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
```

If you have jq installed, you can do this in one step:

```bash
export MEDATARUN_AUTH_TOKEN=$(medatarun auth login --username="admin" --password="admin.0123456789" | jq -r '.access_token')
```

You can verify your current identity:

```bash
medatarun auth whoami
```

### Which server you talk to

By default, the CLI connects to a Medatarun server running locally on http://localhost:8080.

If the server is running on another host or port, you need to tell the CLI where to connect.
This can be done by setting the server host, port, or public base URL in the configuration.

See the [configuration options](../installation/configuration) page for details.

Example:

```
export MEDATARUN_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://medatarun.app.internal.local:9000/medatarun
medatarun auth whoami
```

## Command structure

CLI commands follow a simple structure:

```text
medatarun <actionGroup> <action> [parameters]
```

- `actionGroup` identifies a functional domain (`auth`, `model`, `config`, …)
- `action` identifies the operation to execute
- parameters are passed using named options

Example, to inspect current configuration:

```bash
medatarun config inspect_json
```
This command does not modify anything and is a good way to verify that:

- the server is reachable,
- authentication works,
- the CLI is correctly configured.

## Passing parameters

Parameters are passed using named options, like you did for login before:

```bash
medatarun model import --from="http://my.schemas/schema.json"
```

The option names match the action parameters.

Complex parameter values, that otherwise be Json objects or arrays, shall be quoted and passed as Json.

## Discovering available commands

The CLI is self-describing.

To list available action groups and commands:

```bash
medatarun help
```

To get help for a specific action group:

```bash
medatarun help model
```

To get help for a specific command:

```bash
medatarun help model Import
```

This is the authoritative way to discover commands and parameters.


























Once the server is launched, you can run commands against it. Examples:





```
medatarun config inspect_json
medatarun model import --from="http://my.schemas/schema.json"
medatarun model import --from="datasource:myapp"
medatarun model inspect_json --modelKey=mymodel
medatarun model model_add_tag --modelKey=mymodel --tag="my tag"
```

for example

To get help: `medatarun help` will give you all the commands and parameters, which are the same commands as the API or
what an MCP server can use.
