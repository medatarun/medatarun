# CLI Usage
Once the server is launched, you can run commands against it. Examples:

```
medatarun config InspectJson
medatarun model Import --from="http://my.schemas/schema.json"
medatarun model Import --from="datasource:myapp"
medatarun model Inspect_Json --modelKey=mymodel
medatarun model Model_AddTag --modelKey=mymodel --tag="my tag"
```

for example

To get help: `medatarun help` will give you all the commands and parameters, which are the same commands as the API or
what an MCP server can use.
