# Run Medatarun

This page assumes Medatarun has been installed and the medatarun command is available in your shell.
See [install](./install-from-distribution.mdx).

## Launch the server

Simply run

`medatarun serve`

You will see logs in the console. To stop the server, CTRL+C or Kill.

Now you can browse on http://localhost:8080 to verify that everything is running correctly.

## First access (admin account)

At first startup, Medatarun does not contain any users yet.

To actually start using it, you need to obtain an initial administrator access.
This is a one-time bootstrap step.

Follow the instructions in [Managing users](./manage-users.md)
to create or obtain the initial admin account.

Once this is done, you can log in and start working with Medatarun.

## What next?

From here, you can interact with Medatarun in different ways, depending on what you want to do.
