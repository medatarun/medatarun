- Unzip the file where you want, this is what we will call `MEDATARUN_HOME` directory.

## Launcher

In your `MEDATARUN_HOME` you will find
- `$MEDATARUN_HOME/bin/medatarun` command for MacOS / Linux
- `$MEDATARUN_HOME/bin/medatarun.bat` command for Windows

## Shell integration (optional)


:::tip
In the rest of the documentation, you will regularly start the Medatarun server and run CLI commands.
For convenience, it is recommended to make the `medatarun` command available in your shell.
:::

You can do this in different ways, depending on your environment.

On macOS and Linux, you can either add the bin directory to your PATH, or define a shell alias.

For example, adding `medatarun` to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$MEDATARUN_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

You can place this line in your shell configuration file (`.bash_aliases`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make it persistent.

Alternatively, you can define an alias:

```bash
alias medatarun="$MEDATARUN_HOME/bin/medatarun"
```

On Windows, you can add the `bin` directory to the system `PATH`, or define a command alias depending on the shell you use.

If you prefer not to modify your shell configuration, you can always run Medatarun by calling the executable directly from the `bin` directory.
