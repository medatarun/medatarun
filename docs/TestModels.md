# Test models

## Schemas catalog

File [catalog.csv](catalog.csv) contains schemas to import into medatarun using `medatarun model Import --from=url`.
Look at the `url_raw` column to get direct download URL when available.

- French schema taken from https://github.com/datagouv/schema.data.gouv.fr and especially the file `repertoires.yml`
then converted to CSV with a direct link to the raw file.
